##### Confidence intervals of p
* For Binomially distributed random variables X1, …, Xn, p is to be estimated.
* Mean of a Bernoulli distribution: E(X) = µ = n * p
* Variance of a Bernoulli distribution: Var(X) = σ2 = n * p * (1-p)
* With x successes from n samples, p(bar) = x/n
* Thus, we define a random variable P = 1/(n * X)

* E(P) = E(1/n * X) = 1/n * E(X) = 1/ n * n * p = p
* Var(P) = Var(1/n * X) = 1/n2 * Var(X) = 1/n2 * n * p * (1-p) = 1/n * p * (1-p)
