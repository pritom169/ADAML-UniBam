# Central Limit Theorem, Q-Q-Plots, Normality Test

##### Central Limit Theorem
* The sum of the mean of many random variables independently
drawn from the same distribution is distributed approximately
normally, regardless of the form of the original distribution.
* The sum of the random distributions Yn with Yn = X1 + X2 +...+ Xn
approaches a normal distribution with growing n.
* As a rule of thump: N>30 of independent variables can be considered normally
distributed.
> Exam Question: What is central limit theorem?
> Exam Question: Why are so many observations (heights of plants, weights of individuals, IQ,
weight of a chocolate bar etc.) normally distributed?
>> The aforementioned central limit theorem states that the sum of many independently drawn random
variables converge to be normally distributed. As said, this explains why many physical quantities,
that are often the result of many other random processes, have distributions that are nearly
normal. A normal distribution is thus a very common continuous probability distribution.

##### Quantiles
* Quantiles are points taken at regular intervals from the distribution function (CDF)
of a random variable.
* Quantiles are the data values marking the boundaries between consecutive subsets
    * 2-quantile is called the median
    * 4-quantiles are called quartiles
    * 10-quantiles are called deciles
    * 100-quantiles are called percentiles
* The position quantile is a convenient measure to communicate values of interest: In
company X, the top quartile of women earns more than 80.000 EUR annually.

##### Normality test: A simple graphical method
A Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) is a graphical tool used to assess whether a dataset follows a 
particular theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. It compares the quantiles of the 
observed data with the quantiles of the expected distribution, helping to visually identify deviations
and assess the goodness of fit between the observed and expected distributions.
