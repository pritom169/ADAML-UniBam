# Descriptive statistics vs. inferential statistics
* Descriptive statistics (“beschreibende Statistik”) characterizes data sets or
samples by their parameters (mean, variance, quantiles, etc.).
* In inferential statistics (“schließende Statistik”), the goal is to estimate the
parameters of a distribution X using a sample x1,…xn and thus to infer
something about the population.
